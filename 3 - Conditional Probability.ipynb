    "\n",
    "For example, you are rolling a single die, and you know that the roll of the die comes up odd. What is the probability that you get a 5? \n",
    "\n",
    "In probability notation, you want the probability of the event A = \"roll is a 5\" ***given*** the information B that the roll turned up odd. In other words, P(A|B). After you know that the roll turned up odd, you have only three possibilities: {$1,3,5$}, and each is equally likely. Therefore P(roll is 5|odd) = $1/3$ = $0.33$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without this additional information, the probability of getting a 5 is much lower, i.e., P(roll is 5) = $1/6$ = $0.167$. Thus, knowing that some event happens can change the probability of an event, given this information.\n",
